PIMiner: Parallel Interval Mining of Temporal Patterns using MapReduce

Developed a scalable pattern mining algorithm for large scale interval based data that can run in distributed means on multiple computing nodes using Spark framework. Also depicted the mechanism to store, maintain and process the data in distributed way. Furthermore incorporated both task and data parallelism techniques in the computation which are yet unaddressed with the traditional computing techniques.
